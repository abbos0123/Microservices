# Kafka in Action :link:
Think of Apache Kafka as a high performance software bus that facilitates event streaming, logging, analytics, and other data pipeline tasks. With Kafka, you can easily build features like operational data monitoring and large-scale event processing into both large and small-scale applications.
Kafka in Action introduces the core features of Kafka, along with relevant examples of how to use it in real applications. In it, youâ€™ll explore the most common use cases such as logging and managing streaming data. When youâ€™re done, youâ€™ll be ready to handle both basic developer- and admin-based tasks in a Kafka-focused team.
