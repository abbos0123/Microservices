# Service Discovery Pattern 
The service discovery pattern is mainly used in microservices applications to find the network locations of microservices.

The service discovery pattern uses a centralized server named ‚Äúservice registry‚Äù to maintain a global view of microservices‚Äô network locations. Microservices update their locations in the service registry at fixed intervals. Clients can connect to the service registry and fetch the locations of microservices.
