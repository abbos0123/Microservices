# Service Discovery Pattern 
The service discovery pattern is mainly used in microservices applications to find the network locations of microservices.

The service discovery pattern uses a centralized server named “service registry” to maintain a global view of microservices’ network locations. Microservices update their locations in the service registry at fixed intervals. Clients can connect to the service registry and fetch the locations of microservices.

## Practice 📔
I have done some [practices](https://github.com/abbos0123/Microservices/tree/main/Microservice-Architecture/Event-driven%20architecture/practice) in order to learn some code features of Kafka. In the following table, you can find all practices which I have done.

|1.|[Kafka with two simple services](https://github.com/abbos0123/Microservices/tree/main/Microservice-Architecture/Event-driven%20architecture/practice/connecting-two-micorservices-with-kafka)|In this small practice, I have created one project and build kafka with kafka compose file. Thand configure kafka producers and Kafka listeners in order to pass massage.|:heavy_check_mark:|
